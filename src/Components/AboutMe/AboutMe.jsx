        <p align="justify">Hello, my name is Seyed Sajjad Ghorashi and this is my portfolio website. I graduated from IUST with a degree in material engineering, but I decided to change career and pursue coding and front-end development. (I had a knack for computer based things and graphic design and I used to work with tools like Photoshop and After Effect, so I loved creating and manipulating data and visual elements on the web.) This website is a showcase of my skills and projects that I have done as part of my learning journey. I used various technologies and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, and other React libraries to build this website. I learned a lot of new things and improved my coding abilities through my journey in Daneshkar's React Bootcamp. My goal is to keep growing as a front-end developer and learn more about the latest concepts and technologies in this field.</p>
